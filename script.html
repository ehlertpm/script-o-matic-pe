          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p class="script">Hi. This iPad is a learning device for people like you who may be interested in participating in clinical research studies. Over the next several minutes, this video will explain the details of a study you’re being invited to take part in, and
            help you make a decision about whether you’d like to participate in the study. You’ll learn about your rights and responsibilities, the required study procedures, and the possible risks and benefits of your participation.</p>

          <h4>Knowledge Review</h4>
          <p class="script">
            After watching this video, you’ll take a short knowledge review that will help your doctor assess your understanding of the study and its requirements.
          </p>


          <h4>Sponsor</h4>
          <p class="script">
            This research study is sponsored by Bluecreek Pharmacueticals.</p>


          <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
          <p class="script">You’re being invited to take part in this study because you have been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.</p>

          <h4>Purpose</h4>
          <p class="script">The purpose of this study is to find out about the potential benefits and risks of dectixeze as an add-on treatment for cystic fibrosis.</p>

          <h4>Drug Description</h4>
          <p class="script">Dectixeze is an “investigational drug”, which means that it is being researched for FDA approval. This drug is not yet for sale in the United States.</p>

          <h4>Participants</h4>
          <p class="script">About 330 participants will take part in this study in the United States.</p>

          <h4>Randomization</h4>
          <p class="script">This study is a randomized trial, meaning that you will be assigned by chance to one of 2 treatment groups. In other words, you will have a 50% chance of being assigned to any/either of the treatment groups. Everyone will receive dectixeze or
            a placebo. A placebo looks exactly like the study drug but has no active medicine in it. Neither you nor the study doctor will know which treatment group you are in. </p>

          <h4>Voluntary Participation</h4>
          <p class="script">You may decide to stop your participation at any time. If you decide to stop your participation, your relationship with your doctor and any treatment that you receive outside of the study will not be affected.</p>

          <!-- Informed Consent

          <section class="informed-consent">
            <h3>Informed Consent</h3>
            <h4>Informed Consent Form</h4>
            <p class="script">In order to enter this study, you have to sign a document called the “informed consent form”. By signing this document, you are saying that you understand the risks and benefits of this study and that you’d like to volunteer to take part in
              this study. This iPad will allow you to read the entire informed consent form and to sign it. A copy of the form, with your signature and the signature of the study doctor or a study staff member, will be given to you at the end of this
              process. At any time, you may ask the study doctor or one of the study staff members any questions you might have.</p>

            <h4>Length of Participation</h4>
            <p class="script">If you decide you want to be in this study, your participation will last between twelve and eighteen weeks.</p>

            <h4>Timeline(s)</h4>
            <p class="script">You will visit the study clinic every one to two weeks for the length of your participation. You will return to the clinic for a follow-up visit two weeks after the study is over.</p>
