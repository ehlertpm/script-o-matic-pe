            <p class="question">
              Will participants be required to take a knowledge review as a part of the informed consent process?
              <form>

              <p class="script">You may decide to stop your participation at any time. If you decide to stop your participation, your relationship with your doctor and any treatment that you receive outside of the study will not be affected.</p>
